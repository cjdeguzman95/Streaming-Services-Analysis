# Streaming Services Analysis
#### <i>Technologies: Python (Pandas), Microsoft Power BI</i>

This project demonstrates:
- Ingesting multiple datasets and transforming them into one consolidated masterfile (see code [here](https://github.com/cjdeguzman95/Streaming-Services-Analysis/blob/main/Streaming%20Services/Code/streaming-services-project-data-cleaning.ipynb))
- Creating a star schema data model (see code [here](https://github.com/cjdeguzman95/Streaming-Services-Analysis/blob/main/Streaming%20Services/Code/streaming-services-project-data-modelling.ipynb))
- Creating a Power BI dashboard (WORK IN PROGRESS)

This project explores data from the top three streaming services (Netflix, Amazon Prime and Disney+)

The data is analysed to answer the following questions:
1. If any, what titles are unique to each streaming service?
2. What is the spread of titles across different viewing certifications?
3. Is there a clear leader in delivering a specific media type? (e.g. is Netflix really better for TV Shows compared to the rest?)
